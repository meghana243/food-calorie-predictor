The AI Food Calorie Estimator is a Streamlit-based web application that estimates the nutritional content of food items using image recognition and a pre-trained deep learning model (EfficientNetB0). The app also provides detailed nutritional information based on a local dataset of food items and visualizes the top calorie-rich foods, carbohydrate-rich foods, and category-wise calorie distribution.
